# What's In A Password? 

A presentation that I have given a handful of times on the topic of password security, cracking, and related matters.

## Presented At
- CodeStock 2014
- CodeMash 2014

## Significant Changes
- none


## Credits
The talks I give are never entirely my own. I have ideas, I may put them together in possibly novel ways, but my technical knowledge is an amalgam of input from others within the community - those whom I have read, whose talks I have attended, who have freely placed code, tools, papers online - these folks deserve credit for any good that comes from these talks.
