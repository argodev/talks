# Hiding in Plain Sight [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js)

A presentation that I have given a handful of times on the topic of security, normalcy, and how easy it is to hide your activities amongst the "noise" of a typical computer environment.

## Presented At
- CodeMash 2014
- East Tennessee Cyber Security Summit

## Significant Changes
- Added some stego examples and re-ordered the talk. Also, removed the demo of bypassing the IDS.
- Original Presentation


## Credits
The talks I give are never entirely my own. I have ideas, I may put them together in possibly novel ways, but my technical knowledge is an amalgam of input from others within the community - those whom I have read, whose talks I have attended, who have freely placed code, tools, papers online - these folks deserve credit for any good that comes from these talks.
