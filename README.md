This repo represents the supporting materials for a number of talks I have given. I hope that by making them available in this fashion, they will be helpful to others in the same way that many others who have posted material online have been helpful to me.


## Credits
The talks I give are never entirely my own. I have ideas, I may put them together in possibly novel ways, but my technical knowledge is an amalgam of input from others within the community - those whom I have read, whose talks I have attended, who have freely placed code, tools, papers online - these folks deserve credit for any good that comes from these talks.
