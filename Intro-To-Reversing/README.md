# Intro To Reversing

A presentation that I am delivering for the first time at DevLink 2014. The focus of the discussion is an introduction to tearing apart an exe to attempt to understand what it is doing.

## Presented At
- DevLink 2014

## Significant Changes
- None


## Credits
The talks I give are never entirely my own. I have ideas, I may put them together in possibly novel ways, but my technical knowledge is an amalgam of input from others within the community - those whom I have read, whose talks I have attended, who have freely placed code, tools, papers online - these folks deserve credit for any good that comes from these talks.
